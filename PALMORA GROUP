In response to recent concerns and public criticism around gender inequality at Palmoria Group,
this report presents a thorough analysis of the company’s human resource data across its three operational regions.
Commissioned by the CHRO, Mr. Yunus Shofoluwe, this analysis aims to uncover disparities in workforce representation, pay structure,
and performance evaluations with a particular focus on gender.
Key data cleaning steps were taken to ensure accuracy:
 • Employees with missing salary data (no longer with the company) were excluded.
 • Rows with missing department names were removed.
 • Missing gender values were standardized to “Undisclosed” to maintain inclusiveness.
Through visual exploration using Power BI, the analysis revealed:
 • A noticeable gender imbalance across departments and regions, with some units entirely male-dominated.
 • Signs of gender related performance rating gaps, which may point to unconscious bias in evaluations.
 • A clear gender pay gap, particularly within certain departments such as Engineering and Procurement.
